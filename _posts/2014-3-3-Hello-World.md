title: Goodbye, button!
---

Hello, world!  It's an honored tradition in computer programming, dating back to 1978 and the classic "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.  The idea is simple:  write a minimal computer program to demonstrate the most basic functionality.  You pick the language (or framework) and make something work.  It's a foundation, of almost nothing, on which you hope you can build almost anything.

Now let's change the context of the challenge a bit. If instead of wanting to  "kick the tires" on a new programming language or software framework, suppose you wanted to develop and demonstrate the necessary skills to make a minor improvement to a complex, multi-faceted, open source development project, while following best practices for coding, testing and collaboration with a development team you have never met, and who will accept only production-ready code for their enterprise class project.  That's the new minimal level of competency software engineers need to aspire to in 2018.

So what's "Goodbye, Button"?  I found the project I want to contribute to, and I found a feature enhancement I'd like to implement as my first attempt at collaborative open source development.  When a displayed list of scripts to run is empty, I'm going to remove (or gray-out) the "Run" button associated with the list.  Goodbye, Button!  I expect it to be the most complex, most sweated over, most fretted over, "if-else statement" I have ever written.

Details to come.
